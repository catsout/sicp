        - Evaluating Combinations
        - Compound Procedures
        - The Substitution Model for Procedure Application
        - Conditional Expressions and Predicates
        - Example: Square Roots by Newtonâ€™s Method
        - Procedures as Black-Box Abstractions
    2. Procedures and the Processes They Generate

        - Tree Recursion
        - Orders of Growth
        - Exponentiation
        - Greatest Common Divisors
        - Example: Testing for Primality
    3. Formulating Abstractions with Higher-Order Procedures
        - Procedures as Arguments
        - Constructing Procedures Using lambda
        - Procedures as General Methods
